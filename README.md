# Cartoon Audio2Face Mobile App

This is a cartoon-style mobile app demo built with Python and Kivy. It will eventually sync cartoon character facial animations to audio using NVIDIA's Audio2Face technology.

## Features

- Cartoon avatar display.
- Button to simulate syncing lips to audio (stub for Audio2Face).
- Ready for future integration with NVIDIA Audio2Face SDK.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.7+ and pip.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Place your cartoon avatar in `assets/cartoon_avatar.png`.
4. Run the app:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Next Steps

- Integrate real-time audio facial animation using NVIDIA Audio2Face SDK/API.
- Build for Android/iOS using Kivy's build tools (e.g., buildozer).
- Improve cartoon assets and animation.
